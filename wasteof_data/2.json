Bees with hand-shaped hats on, rotating around a wheel to catch drips of honey. Adam\\u2019s hand shoots up. ADAM Can anyone work on the Krelman? TRUDY Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it\\u2019s done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations. But choose carefully, because you\\u2019ll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life. The bees CHEER. ANGLE ON: Barry\\u2019s smile dropping slightly. BARRY The same job for the rest of your life? I didn\\u2019t know that. ADAM What\\u2019s the difference?

That\\u2019s more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime. ADAM (playing with the pollen) It\\u2019s just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it.

ADAM (CONT\\u2019D) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there\\u2019s a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can\\u2019t explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I\\u2019m sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we\\u2019re just a couple of bugs in this world.

JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, it\\u2019s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don\\u2019t make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven\\u2019t these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\\u2019s valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. He\\u2019s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT\'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\\u2019s motion. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can\\u2019t. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper\'s SMOKER onto the judge\\u2019s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY It\\u2019s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn\\u2019t hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \\"Smoking or Non?\\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery\'s racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He\'s playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge\\u2019s bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees!

I\\u2019m okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we won\\u2019t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson!

The Press follows Barry as he EXITS. ANGLE ON: Adam and Vanessa. ADAM (putting papers away) What if Montgomery\\u2019s right? VANESSA What do you mean?

BARRY How hard could it be? VANESSA Wait a minute. Barry, we\\u2019re headed into some lightning. CUT TO: Vanessa shrugs, and takes the controls. SEQ. 4150 - \\u201cBARRY FLIES PLANE\\u201d INT.

Barry\\u2019s family and Adam watch from their living room. Bees sitting on the street curb turn around to watch the TV. BARRY Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you, because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That\\u2019s why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 117. Working together. That\\u2019s the bee way. We\\u2019re not made of Jello.

JOCK You ever see pollination up close? BARRY No, Sir. He takes off, and the excess pollen dust falls causing the flowers to come back to life.

MONTGOMERY (grumbles, clears his throat) Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man\'s divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we were to live in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what it would mean. Maybe I would have to negotiate with the silk worm for the elastic in my britches. Talking bee. How do we know this isn\\u2019t some sort of holographic motion picture capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams, robotics, ventriloquism, cloning...for all we know he could be on steroids! Montgomery leers at Barry, who moves to the stand. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 73. JUDGE Mr. Benson? Barry makes his opening statement. BARRY Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, there\\u2019s no trickery here. I\\u2019m just an ordinary bee. And as a bee, honey\\u2019s pretty important to me. It\\u2019s important to all bees. We invented it, we make it, and we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take whatever they want from us cause we\\u2019re the little guys. And what I\\u2019m hoping is that after this is all over, you\\u2019ll see how by taking our honey, you\\u2019re not only taking away everything we have, but everything we are.

VANDERHAYDEN No. BARRY I\\u2019m sorry. I couldn\\u2019t hear you. MR. VANDERHAYDEN (louder) No. BARRY No. Because you don\\u2019t free bees. You keep bees. And not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey? MR. VANDERHAYDEN Well, they\\u2019re very lovable creatures. Yogi-bear, Fozzy-bear, Build-a-bear. BARRY Yeah, you mean like this?! Vanessa and the SUPERINTENDANT from her building ENTER with a GIANT FEROCIOUS GRIZZLY BEAR. He has a neck collar and chains extending from either side. \\"Bee Movie\\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 75. By pulling the chains, they bring him directly in front of Vanderhayden.

BARRY Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I\'m feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say, (looking in folder) Mr. Gordon M. Sumner? The jury GASPS.

KEN That\\u2019s where I usually sit. Right there. VANESSA (O.C) Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that \\u201ceating with chopsticks\\u201d isn\\u2019t really a special skill. KEN (to Barry) You think I don\\u2019t see what you\\u2019re doing? BARRY Hey look, I know how hard it is trying to find the right job. We certainly have that in common. KEN Do we? BARRY Well, bees have 100% employment, of course. But we do jobs like taking the crud out. KEN That\\u2019s just what I was thinking about doing. Ken holds his table knife up.

BARRY I love the smell of flowers. KEN Yeah? How do you like the smell of flames? Ken lights the stream. BARRY Not as much. Barry flies in a circle. Ken, trying to stay with him, spins in place. ANGLE ON: Flames outside the bathroom door. Ken slips on the Italian Vogue, falls backward into the shower, pulling down the shower curtain. The can hits him in the head, followed by the shower curtain rod, and the rubber duck. Ken reaches back, grabs the handheld shower head. He whips around, looking for Barry. ANGLE ON: A WATERBUG near the drain. WATERBUG Waterbug. Not taking sides. Barry is on the toilet tank. He comes out from behind a shampoo bottle, wearing a chapstick cap as a helmet.

BARRY Of course. I\\u2019m sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we\\u2019re just a couple of bugs in this world.

The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \\"Smoking or Non?\\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?

However, it is currently facing the challenge of attracting more users to its platform. To address this issue, <strong><u>Wasteof.money</u></strong> has come up with a couple of strategies. Firstly, they are planning to create a podcast that will serve as a marketing tool to increase their user base. Secondly, they have made their app available on the app store to make it more accessible to potential users. However, one area they could improve on is their branding. The current domain name, \\"<strong><u>Wasteof.money</u></strong>\\", sounds unprofessional and may not instill confidence in potential users. They could consider changing their domain name to something more serious and professional, such as \\"<strong><u>Wasteof.org</u></strong>\\" or \\"<strong><u>Wasteof.com</u></strong>\\". Another strategy that <strong><u>Wasteof.money</u></strong> has not yet explored is advertising through sponsorships on YouTube channels. They could identify suitable channels such as Griffpatch or any other YouTube channels with a similar target audience and collaborate with them to promote their platform. By doing so, they could potentially increase their visibility and attract more users to their website. Overall, with a combination of effective marketing strategies and a more professional branding approach, <strong><u>Wasteof.money</u></strong> could potentially grow their user base and become a more successful platform.</p>", "replies": []}, {"user": "witow", "content": "<p>Hello, this is an alt account, here I talk about what should happen to wasteof for the website to get more popular, and share my opinion on the website.
