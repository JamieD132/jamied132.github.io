Some interesting obstacles are enumerated here. In 1983, Harry Donalds stood knocking outside people's houses and engaged in 'pointless conversation' with them. One citizen reported having a 45-minute long conversation where Harry described individual snowflakes he had seen last winter. In 1989, residents woke up to find sheep on their roofs. It is still unknown who executed this. In 1995, a child named Johnny Wilson brought a grand piano to a central location, and smashed the keys while screaming incoherently whenever someone was nearby. In 2004, one unknown resident covered the entire area of Barriertown with chairs. It took 5 days for all of them to be collected. The exact same chairs were used again in 2005, prompting people to begin destroying them.

The time could be right, given recent changes to the service. All you need to know on getting started.\r\n\r\nBefore diving in, it’s been well discussed that Snapchat’s user interface can be confusing to newcomers, especially older people — with “older” being like 25 or over.\r\n\r\nAfter spending time with my own teenagers, I don’t think it’s that only young people “get” Snapchat. I think that it’s young people teach each other how to navigate the app when they see each other in person. My kids learned Snapchat from their friends. In turn, they pass on tips to others.\r\n\r\nThe Snapchat app has a “social UI,” if you will, one that encourages people to be social with others in real life in order to be social virtually within the app. Whether this is by accident (likely) or intentional, I don’t know. But that’s why I think oldsters like me or anyone without friends they see in person who regularly use Snapchat struggle.\r\n\r\nOnce you get that it’s not you — that Snapchat isn’t easily figured out without a little help — you may feel a bit better. I sure did.\r\n\r\nSigning up is straightforward. You’ll need to provide your name, a birthdate and an email address or phone number. If you’re making an account for your company or brand, you’ll have to fake a birthdate. Make it so your company is aged 18 or over, so you don’t wind up classified as a child.\r\n\r\nThere’s no explicit support for business accounts. That means as a brand, you have no real protection if one person in charge of your account goes rogue. So, make sure you trust your people.\r\n\r\nUnlike most social networks, there’s no significant profile to establish. You won’t have a bio. You won’t get a URL to your site. You can have a custom picture, but you can’t upload an image to use. You’ll have to take it live, as explained further below. Some lucky Snapchat accounts can be verified, but there’s no formal procedure for this.\r\n\r\nYou’ll also have to create a unique username, up to 15 characters long. This is different from your regular name. Pick carefully, because you can’t change your username. You can change the regular name that’s associated with it, however.\r\n\r\nBy default, your Snapcode will be empty. If you want to add your photo, tap on the ghost. A new screen will appear with the ghost image enlarged, and you can put your face within it. Tap on the camera button below the ghost to take your picture. A series of pictures will be taken, to create an animated profile picture. If you don’t like it, tap the camera button again to take another. When you’re happy, tap on the < icon to the left of the camera circle to save and return to the profile screen.\r\n\r\nIn some places, Snapchat will use a Bitmoji image rather than your ghost, if you’ve created one. To do that, select the “Create Bitmoji” icon at the top left of the profile screen. This is optional, and even if you do it, your Bitmoji image will not replace any custom image within your Snapcode.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, you’ll have a unique username. In my case, it’s “sullivandanny.” But you also have a regular name to make it easier for others to find and identify you. If you don’t have one or want to change it, tap on the gear icon at the top right of your profile screen. Then select the first option, “Name,” where you can set a first and last name. Use the < icon in the top left to get back to your profile screen when finished.\r\n\r\nFrom there, you can tap on “Added Me” to see who has added you (and you can add them back, if you want). You don’t have to add people. By swiping across to the left on their names, you can select “Ignore” if you don’t want to see them listed any longer on your Added Me list. You can also block anyone this way, too.\r\n\r\nUnlike other social media networks, there’s no way to see all the people who have added you. The Added Me list will only show the last 200 or so people. You won’t get an overall count nor a complete list. Nor is your Snapchat “score” — that number below your username — a count of followers. That’s simply a mystery figure that Snapchat calculates based on the number of snaps you’ve sent, received, stories posted and other factors.\r\n\r\nThe core part of Snapchat is making Snaps: pictures and videos that you’ll share with followers.\r\n\r\nPicture- and video-taking is pretty easy. From the home screen shown earlier, tap on the big circle camera button at the bottom to take a picture. Tap and hold if you want to record a video. If you need flash, use the flash icon in the top right of the home screen. If you want to use the front-facing camera for a selfie, use the camera switch icon in the top right.

Let's break them down:\r\n\r\nUpdated visibility settings: Parents can view who their children are sharing stories with, their contact settings, and their SnapMap settings. And while Snap says they default underage accounts to the strictest privacy settings available, kids can change them at any time. Similarly, any parental control setting can be unilaterally turned off by the kid at any time as they're not PIN code protected.\r\n\r\nNew AI settings: Parents will now be able to restrict the ability for My AI, Snapchat's AI-powered chatbot, to respond to chats. This sounds like something important, but the real threat on Snapchat to children comes primarily from other users, not the bot.\r\n\r\nEasier access to Family Center: They've updated their user interface to make the parental control settings easier to find. It doesn't matter how prominent they make Family Center as long as there's no PIN code to protect the settings parents put in place.\r\n\r\nFor many parents, it’s the bane of their existence. It’s the app that every kid wants and every kid seems to have before yours does. Parents are constantly asking why kids are so attracted to it and, more importantly, how to monitor Snapchat. The app came out in 2011 and has been popular ever since for its unique photo messaging and fun face filters. It’s also the first app to introduce stories to the social media scene.\r\n\r\nBut its popularity among kids has brought certain risks that have proven tricky for kids — and parents — to navigate. That’s why we put this handy guide together to give parents the low-down on everything you need to know about its features, as well as how to keep your kids safe. \r\n\r\nFor many kids, Snapchat is an essential pillar of their social life. One main reason for this is the instantaneous connection it provides kids with their peers. Whether it’s through stories or direct messages, users can easily share the happenings of their day with a text, photo, or video. Other platforms like Instagram and TikTok are more about the content, like posting edited selfies or scrolling through entertaining videos. But Snapchat serves a slightly different purpose in providing a quick and unique way to interact with your friends. This is exemplified in Snapstreaks, a feature that essentially records how many days in a row you’ve sent a Snapchat to another user. \r\n\r\nBut make no mistake, Snapchat still has lots of content to consume. Kids can find some of their favorite celebrities and influencers on Snapchat and get an inside look at their everyday lives. Just like any other social media, kids can easily find themselves scrolling through the Discover page for hours at a time. \r\n\r\nSnapchat was the first app to introduce disappearing messages and parents have been battling the misconceptions that come with it ever since. Kids are quick to believe that since the messages disappear, they can send whatever they want without any repercussions. But the truth is that the messages are never really gone — kids have been known to screenshot, either with their own phone or with another phone to take a picture of the messages. This feature has made Snapchat a hotspot for the spread of tons of inappropriate behavior, such as cyberbullying, sexting, drug sales, predation, and more. \r\n\r\nOn the flip side, there’s still a danger even if the messages do disappear because this means there’s no record of any misbehavior that may happen on the platform. So for things like cyberbullying, you wouldn’t have the context or the evidence you need to bring to the school, for instance. The app is inherently secretive, which can cause a lot of grief for the parents, kids, and anyone else involved in a sticky situation. \r\n\r\nThe Discover page, as previously mentioned, is like Snapchat’s public feed for their more prominent users, brands, and publications. Users can find any and all types of content here. And the page runs on clickbait, which means the more shocking or eye-catching a video is, the more views it’s likely to get. \r\n\r\nParents should know that Snapchat’s Discover page has a high propensity for overtly sexual content and generally concerning content. Aside from this, it’s also addictive just like TikTok and other short-form video platforms.\r\n\r\nSnapchat has a location feature where you can see where your friends are, as well as post a story to the “OurStory” feature that’s based on a location or event. For example, you can look up a school or concert and look at stories from users in that specific area. Kids could find (or be found by) strangers through this feature, which is a serious privacy concern. Sadly, we know that online predators flock to the platforms where the kids are, and this feature opens the door to kids being targeted for grooming and other predatory tactics.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Snapchat, the best strategy a parent has is communication. Once you’ve done your own research on the app and understand its dangers, talk to your kid about what you’ve learned. Especially with the disappearing messages, it’s extremely difficult to catch all potentially inappropriate activity on the platform. However, it provides a great opportunity to teach kids about why online safety is so important and give them the tools they need if they encounter these dangers. Whether your kids already have Snapchat or they’re just asking for it, make sure they’re educated on the risks and know you’re a safe place to go, no matter what.\r\n\r\nWhile Snapchat still has a long way to go in making its platform safe for kids, parents should still take advantage of what parental controls they offer. Parents can use Family Center to link their own personal Snapchat accounts with their kids to get some general insights into the child’s app activity.

After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, it was enlarged to include some former Soviet and Warsaw Pact countries.\r\n\r\nPutin has repeatedly cast the post-Cold War expansion of NATO as evidence of the West's arrogant way of dealing with Russia's security concerns.\r\n\r\nUnder Article 5 of the NATO treaty, 'the Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all'.\r\n\r\nPutin said that Finland's entry into NATO in April would force Russia to 'concentrate certain military units' in northern Russia near their border.\r\n\r\n**COLD WAR?**\r\n\r\nThe failure of Ukraine's counteroffensive this year has raised questions in the West and inside Ukraine about just how realistic the Ukrainian and Western aims of defeating Russian forces in Ukraine are.\r\n\r\nOfficials in Moscow and the West have repeatedly spoken of a 'new Cold War', with Russia and China on one side and the West on the other.\r\n\r\nAsked about how common ground could be found with the West given the rhetoric on both sides, Putin said: 'They will have to find common ground because they will have to reckon with us.'\r\n\r\nA senior U.S. State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said last month that Putin would not make peace before he knows the results of the November election in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe West, Putin said, had failed to understand the extent of the changes ushered in by the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, which he said had removed any genuine ideological basis for a confrontation between Russia and the West.\r\n\r\n'I really did have a naive impression,' Putin, a former KGB spy who rose to power in 1999, said of his impressions of the world in 2000.\r\n\r\n'The reality is that after the fall of the Soviet Union, they considered that they just had to wait for a bit to completely destroy Russia,' Putin said.\r\n\r\nPutin casts the war as part of a much bigger struggle with the United States, which the Kremlin elite says aims to cleave Russia apart, grab its vast natural resources and then turn to settling scores with China.\r\n\r\nThe West, which presents Russia and China as its main threats, says it has no plan to destroy Russia. Ukraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from its territory.\r\n\r\n#news\r\n", "user": "vision_media"}, {"id": "399672d65fb2ceea745fe630", "content": "#etchbox", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "3134ac67243144883218686e", "content": "50% off #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2ee60216c940463559a7e033", "content": "#nightymorning", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2dd9e12e8a3dfe71ecf1b2f0", "content": "skibidi #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "31bd8f001ed2ac95001d0ae5", "content": "yep #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "361037b0b609752555509263", "content": "more positive (just in case) #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2f54a90322cb1f02f6ae2f08", "content": "couldn't find anything than those #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2d5bc794825ddd6e0872ad70", "content": "sad #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2d8b7968b440eca4fa4a0552", "content": "animals #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2f146a497b7977fd70433e9f", "content": "what is that pokemon leak? what is the real pokemon lore? #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "382856153d3d9bac35c4983d", "content": "so many gigabytes... #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2c900897f3abb71fd026f78b", "content": "social media #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2c7f9615e89d75d2ca5774a4", "content": "%memes\r\n\r\n**test**\r\n*memes*\r\n**memes**\r\n\r\n~~give me idea for what prefix letter to use instead of ``^``~~", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2cd5942d823e896ce18b3c60", "content": "@jinx any art progress?", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2ce062334eee93d77362a881", "content": "What is the best color for a cat?", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2ded3e0680be1081a75d08d0", "content": "anyways, I seen a bird just crap in front of me on the freshly painted balcony", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2f20bc96fe78d3dd29d1806b", "content": "5 days remaining guys! if you haven't voted then vote", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "2fca01088c5a60d2886b5174", "content": "vote y'all", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "3003adcc905a92ae4ce2c95b", "content": "this is some good 2015 video:\r\nhttps:/\/www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE2LZN8ayVw", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "3016376512ded5fc170202cf", "content": " one athlete will be executed for sure\r\nbut they're doing very good in table tennis right now", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "3093145c82ce8eca16dcbf87", "content": "which animal emoji is the best?", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "31f4e6a71db3ed12bb0d9534", "content": " the winner of this competition is @cheesewhisk3rs with 6 votes! but she already have the verification badge so what should we do?

These proxies can be configured to log IP addresses to a file, which many sites already do for moderation (i.e. finding potential ban evasion accounts). Without logging, a server will still need your IP to initiate a TCP or UDP socket connection.\r\n\r\nAnother trusted third-party with access to your IP is unlikely to cause harm, especially with the many websites and servers that a person has connected to in their lifetime.\r\n\r\nWorst case, IP addresses can narrow down a location, but the approximation is usually not exact enough to doxx someone's address or city.

Just milk. This entire subreddit consists of 'milk alternatives.' Almost every 'milk' post I see on here has something like almond or soy in it. The fact that this subreddit is called 'r/milk' is nothing short of utter blasphemy.\r\n\r\nLet me start out by saying I have nothing against milk alternatives, I just hate their association with actual milk. Want to add almonds or oats and blend it up into some liquid? That’s almond milk or oat milk, not milk. Totally different. Want to make a latte with some fancy coconut stuff? I don’t even know what the hell you'd call that, but it's not milk.\r\n\r\nI would be more than willing to wager I’ve drunk more cow’s milk in my 25 years than any of you have in your entire lives. I drink it almost every day and sometimes more than one glass. Want to personalize your milk? Maybe you can choose whole, skim, or 2%. But if you want to use almond or soy and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled 'milk_alternatives' because that is not actual milk.\r\n\r\nI’m not a scientist nor am I anything close to a dairy farmer, but as a bland white mid-western male, I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to milk. All you foodies, vegans, and lactose-intolerants stay the hell away from our milk and stop associating your nut-based liquids with it. It’s utter blasphemy, and it rocks me to the core of my calcium-enriched being.\r\n\r\nHell, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I’ve seen post after post of people’s 'milks' all over Reddit, and it’s been driving me insane. The moment I saw this subreddit this morning, I finally snapped. I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.\r\n\r\nYou goddamn heretics. Respect milk and stop changing it into whatever plant-based slurry you like.

It seems almost unthinkable that a few years ago we weren’t all worrying about the best angle for a selfie or whether to snap a quick picture of our food to upload to Instagram before it goes cold.\r\n\r\nA photo and video messaging app that has seen a huge surge in popularity is Snapchat. This app, which is primarily aimed at a younger audience, allows users to send videos and images to their contacts with the premise that these messages will be automatically eliminated after a few moments. Users set a time limit for how long recipients can view their Snaps (as of September 2015, the range is from 1 to 10 seconds) after which Snapchat claims they will be deleted from the company’s servers.\r\n\r\nHowever, the application has seen some worrying issues relating to its security. For example, just last year the credentials of 4.6 million U.S. Snapchat users, such as usernames and phone numbers, were made public on the Internet. Despite introducing a new two-step verification process to help boost the app’s security, here are a few things to keep in mind before you let your child get too snap-happy.\r\n\r\nEven though your child might think that they are sending the picture of video to their friends, remind them that the app has been hacked in the past and that if it happens again, their images could be made public. So advise them not to send something they wouldn’t want the whole world to see.\r\n\r\nDespite the notion that pictures sent to contacts expire automatically after a set period of time, there are various ways around this and it’s worth pointing it out to your children.\r\n\r\nFor example, users are often able to take screenshots of photos and videos which are intended to be ephemeral using standard screen capture features on their smartphone or even by using special software to save the image.\r\n\r\nSo after following the above steps, next is to ensure that a stranger can’t send your child unsuitable images or contact them. To change the settings to ensure that only their friends can send them messages, tap the ghost icon at the top of the screen to access your child’s profile, then tap the gear cog icon in the upper-right corner, under the Settings menu go to “Receive Snaps from…” and ensure that it says “My Friends” instead of “Everyone”.\r\n\r\nFinally, if someone has been harassing your child you can delete and block them from the same section of the menu as the step above. You can also write to safety Snapchat and they will resolve the issue. If still don’t feel comfortable letting your child use the app, you can delete their account and entering the username and password.\r\n\r\nRemember, no matter how much freedom you want to allow your children when using social media, it always pays to keep them informed of the dangers it can pose, too.", "user": "snapchat"}, {"id": "37bb56b8bebfc5451e6caf34", "content": "I can't post over like 6 platforms, I am focusing on bluesky as it has more content: https:/\/bsky.app/profile/finleys.bsky.social", "user": "blahaj"}, {"id": "3907eacb0820f6be694cc65f", "content": "gay darflen logo", "user": "blahaj"}, {"id": "2caafe80705f630fd5cff831", "content": "is chatmander dead", "user": "germany"}, {"id": "3498ca5502cc9579de69807b", "content": "My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady", "user": "slimshady"}, {"id": "2e90de908106740ad7f43a0c", "content": "Alt of @PersonWhoCool", "user": "PersonWhoCool_2"}, {"id": "373dd3f6a5ad7931d15541fe", "content": "bro no way - @jinx 's cat revealed", "user": "rfnjgrinjfujgniiitjnhue"}, {"id": "3632b260891d8eea50a15f88", "content": "#ralseiappreciationday", "user": "alex"}, {"id": "32635809111059f8d7c3f136", "content": "i absolutely *hate* romanian homework ", "user": "alex"}, {"id": "346d31c17b449ef13e373a63", "content": "darflen can't handle prabskibidi", "user": "alex"}, {"id": "2f42b7db97431e9d7b645f11", "content": "What is your favorite Darfren account?", "user": "dog"}, {"id": "349f697c106f80290b26c937", "content": "whereeeee have youuu beeeeeeeeeen\r\n\r\n(you know who you are)", "user": "itsgiving"}, {"id": "34c96c54aa066e1c6f5a3a79", "content": "I'm O.K.\r\n\r\nnot that anybody ASKED.\r\n\r\nmeow.\r\n\r\n🦈", "user": "itsgiving"}, {"id": "340a4f0fc445f2c40c5fd55a", "content": "My logo", "user": "_-peking-_"}, {"id": "35a7b9b723990a870a00976e", "content": "Hourly post", "user": "stlucianguy"}, {"id": "35300a31e1fa94a20c874184", "content": "見ろよこのサイズ感ぴったりすぎて名刺にしたい", "user": "crown7q"}, {"id": "3206fc83a4806290f1cb9623", "content": "えすれだよ", "user": "srain_3"}, {"id": "322333d5c7174f78706e7765", "content": "自習かみーーーー", "user": "saito01"}, {"id": "316fcc6d8b640ae9ce01c92a", "content": "WHO POSTED MY NUDES ON DARFLEN DOT COM????.", "user": "eggman"}, {"id": "322ebfe799d5447c71c4cd6f", "content": "暇", "user": "vktzz"}, {"id": "30ccc506b4614a18e431724f", "content": "https:/\/scratch.mit.edu/projects/1077192886/ The latest intro I made", "user": "sorairo0323"}, {"id": "2f95a65f5d572490c1305b09", "content": "Will I marry him? lol", "user": "neetdzn"}, {"id": "3939699f0e9abde74b7f10ce", "content": "Japanese is difficultXD", "user": "neetdzn"}, {"id": "38e3d02c81468746b54be804", "content": "", "user": "rei"}, {"id": "356ba22b4f797d50142e2bb1", "content": "whut", "user": "qxva_site"}, {"id": "2d7fa4a002bc45151f8dbff4", "content": "Le bolah empire 😈\r\nFounded 31/12/2023\r\nIdk what info to put anymore", "user": "mirvik"}, {"id": "2ed74d97fbed68827ec5e8fd", "content": "13 days since my last post!\r\ni guess you could say not-darflen!\r\n\r\n(do you get it, do you get it, **not**-darflen, do you get it)", "user": "speedbee411"}, {"id": "32b15430fbd7863c3047bb0a", "content": "https:/\/darflen.com/posts/b452e88c2966eb59c0cf31f5\r\nOctober 28, 2024 (streak of 6)", "user": "speedbee411"}, {"id": "31d27fa427e43e06a417eebc", "content": "⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣤⠀⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢠⣿⢷⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⡴⠟⢹⡄⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⣼⠙⠀⠙⢷⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣤⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⠞⠋⠀⠀⠈⣇⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⢠⡇⠀⠀⠀⠈⠻⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣯⠉⠛⠓⠶⣤⡀⠀⢀⣴⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⣸⠑⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⢷⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣧⠀⠀⠀⠈⠙⢶⡞⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⣦⢀⣠⡴⠞⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⢸⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠐⠛⠛⠲⠶⠶⠶⠶⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠸⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣤⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣾⡆⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⡀⠀⠀⢩⡏⠉⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⣿⣿⣇⠀⢹⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣰⠇⠀⠀\r\n⣤⣤⣤⡤⠾⠃⠀⠀⢸⡄⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿⠂⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⢀⡇⠀⠀⢀⣀⣼⣧⣄⣀⣀\r\n⠀⠉⠛⠶⣤⠀⠀⠀⠘⢗⠀⠈⠻⠿⠃⠀⠦⠴⠄⠀⠀⠈⠻⠟⠁⠀⠈⢁⡀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣴⠞⠋⠁\r\n⠀⠀⠀⢀⡾⠃⢀⣴⢾⣟⣠⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡀⠀⠀⣠⠄⠀⠀⠀⢠⡶⣿⣧⡼⠆⠀⢻⡀⠀⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⢀⣾⣁⣀⣀⢀⣚⡛⠉⠀⠀⠀⠈⠓⠋⠙⠓⠚⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠛⠋⠀⠀⠀⢈⣻⡀⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠙⣟⣦⣄⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣤⡴⠃⠛⠛⠋⠉⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⣏⠛⠛⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⣯⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣙⣷⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⢷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠴⣿⣭⣂⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⣧⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠘⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\r\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀", "user": "boykisser"}, {"id": "2d20eeb201dc2fa2c1822922", "content": "Listen, I get why @qxva was banned. *sobs* They did someone which is against the terms of service.

The telling 'cats have 9 lives' actually comes from one of the most famous wrestling cat named 'Garfield' which survived 9 close to death situations in his wrestling career. In 1978, Jim Davis, who was a huge fan of cat wrestling during his childhood, re-popularized the name 'Garfield' by starting a comic about a cat named the same as the famous wrestling cat.

Doesn't matter what thoughts come out. As you certainly know by now: thinking is a luxury act, any new ideas are appreciated. If reading this whole thing made you consider any new ideas, then I have succeeded. My work here is done.'\r\n\r\nWell, here's a thought experiment. Has it already happened unintentionally, or possibly even been done intentionally? Even if incomplete, has it already *attempted* to happen? I don't know and I'm very interested in the answer. History is one of my bigger weaknesses when it comes to this kind of stuff.\r\nStep 0: Be popular enough for any of what you're about to do have some kind of observable effect.\r\nStep 1: Pick your favorite fallacy.\r\nStep 2: Use that fallacy to justify already popular stuff.\r\nStep 3: Slowly start using the fallacy for stuff that others would agree with but haven't thought about yet.\r\nStep 4: I'm not entirely sure what the best execution of this step is, but it's one of these two:\r\n- Point out the fallacy and stuff it justifies, marketing it as a legitimate reasoning strategy in a way that makes your audience use it regularly. I'm not sure how well it would work, given discussing specific reasoning isn't a thing I hear of often, but if it does work it's going to be a lot faster and be easier to observe.\r\n- Alternatively, just continue what you were already doing until people subconsciously start using the fallacy. It will be slow and hard to observe, but it seems more likely to work to me and could be more effective (others not in your audience might start using it subconsciously by proxy)?\r\nStep 5: Record results. Is the fallacy now permanently ingrained in popular culture? Can people now easily justify anything, or even better, specifically the things that *you* like with a single easy trick?

We understand that whatever damage is done cannot be reversed, and we hope you forgive us for what we’ve done, however we understand if you choose not to. We respect our communities and love everyone no matter what, and we want to show our respect to our fellow Blazers by doing so. Moving forward, our brand will be 100% politically neutral, like it has been before, and will only focus on what the platform is about, and that is bringing communities together. As such, we have decided to remove and retract all the comments and posts defending and endorsing the former president off of this platform. Whoever you guys decide to vote for is completely up to you, and the results will speak for themselves.

human and breathe above water? paradock, darf, darfield, etc. so i think lord darf would be a good name", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "4be4f77da35efae7760dcc2c", "content": "@500", "user": "qxva"}, {"id":

Or perhaps those ads keep popping up on your social media feed? It’s taken the world by storm with its huge array of products for incredibly cheap prices. But what actually is Temu? Is it legit? And should you buy from it? Here’s everything you need to know before you starting typing in your credit card. \r\n\r\nYou can buy basically anything you can imagine on the app, as there are tens of thousands of products across 100 different categories.\r\n\r\nCategories include women's and men’s clothing, home and kitchen, baby clothes, kid's fashion, beauty and health, jewellery, toys and electronics.\r\n\r\nYou can even buy power tools, musical instruments, accessories for your car, office and school supplies, mobile phones and everything in between.\r\n\r\nYou might think Temu sounds like Shein, Wish, or AliExpress, but Temu’s distinctive feature is that it’s even cheaper than those stores. \r\n\r\nWe’re talking, necklaces for $1, pet collars for $3 and tops for $8. You could even pick up a blender for as little as $10, air fryer for $15, smart watches for under $20 and even wedding dresses for as little as $30.\r\n\r\nMost items are priced at less than $40, making it extremely competitive with other e-commerce websites. \r\n\r\nSo how do they get prices so cheap? Well, it has something to do with Temu’s business model.\r\n\r\nInstead of owning the products that they sell, Temu just facilitates the buying process.\r\n\r\nThe app streamlines the purchasing process by connecting shoppers with suppliers which ends up bringing down the costs of goods. Most of these suppliers are Chinese factories or warehouses.\r\n\r\nWorking with this network of suppliers means Temu can maintain its competitive pricing strategy.\r\n\r\nIt all depends on how you define ‘legit’...\r\n\r\nYes, Temu is a real company operating out of Boston in the US. According to its website, they employ 10,000 employees around the world. \r\n\r\nSince starting, they’ve processed over 60 billion orders from over 11 million customers worldwide. So yes, the products on Temu are real.\r\n\r\nBut is the site legit, as in, actually good?\r\n\r\nWell, some people claim that the things they ordered look slightly different than the photos on the website, the sizing can sometimes be off and the quality is quite low. Others have also reported that trying to get a refund is a nightmare.\r\n\r\nTemu is also starting to get a reputation for undelivered packages, long shipping times, mysterious charges, incorrect orders and unresponsive customer service.\r\n\r\nBasically, you get the products and services you pay for.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Better Business Bureau, Temu has a customer rating of below 1.5 stars and over 600 complaints since it launched.\r\n\r\nHowever, on social media, many people have made videos with positive reviews about the app and have said they were satisfied with the products they received.\r\n\r\nA lot of people also love how many 'dupes' there are of popular brand-name products.\r\n\r\nLike most websites and apps these days, Temu collects data from you. \r\n\r\nWhen you create an account and visit Temu's app home page, they can collect information such as your location, device ID, your search history, payment information and contacts. \r\n\r\nIt's not known what they use this data for, but other apps use this sort of data to track users across different apps and websites, to better understand your shopping behaviour so they can target you with relevant ads. \r\n\r\nOther than privacy concerns, Temu is also controversial for failing to comply with the Uyghur Forced Labour Act. This means that there are doubts about its adherence to labour and human rights standards in China. \r\n\r\nAccording to a US congressional report published in June, 'Temu fails to maintain 'even the facade of a meaningful compliance program' that seeks to prevent goods made by forced labour from being sold on its platform.'\r\n\r\nSo, should you buy from Temu? It's completely up to you! The decision to shop with Temu should rest on your own personal comfort level with things such as data privacy, labour ethics and the potential to receive low-quality products. \r\n\r\nIf you are going to shop with Temu, perhaps start with buying just a few small items, see how that experience goes and then commit to bigger orders.\r\n\r\nThat way, you don't have much to lose (other than a few bucks and maybe your personal data!)", "user": "temu"}, {"id": "5518e513d552cbe662d4050a", "content": "meow :3", "user": "alex"}, {"id": "5305c81bea80439f3b290520", "content": "JANX DIED...", "user": "janx"}, {"id": "55d533e0c196185e7afa2533", "content": "Example", "user": "Example"}, {"id": "47fb57a2718d8651a1679a67", "content": "a", "user": "_-peking-_"}, {"id": "52345f4a7fc6418548cb898e", "content": "私が今いる日本では15時から16時くらいです。あなたの場所は何時ですか？\r\n\r\nIt is about 15:00 to 16:00 in Japan where I am now.

2024)\r\n\r\n__**Communities**__\r\n\r\n-Request To Join communities\r\n\r\n-Moderation tools in communities where owners and mods can delete posts and edit them in their respective communities (if edited, it would show that it was edited by a mod, credits to @fir)\r\n\r\n-Popup appearing when you repost to select the location of the repost ( would show your profile at the top and a list of all your communities)\r\n\r\n-ability to delete owned communities (by @fir)\r\n\r\n-option to disable / enable a community's tag on posts\r\n\r\n-make community tags on post the community's display name\r\n\r\n__**Badges**__\r\n\r\n-Make badges visible from posts (anti-impersonation)\r\n\r\n-Add a bug hunter badge to give an incentive for bug abusers to report them\r\n\r\n__**Personalisation**__\r\n\r\n-Change default profile picture to darf and make to able to be customized with preset cosmetics (suggestion by @--)\r\n\r\n-Coloured name tags, to prevent visibility issues with this feature all name tags would have a white outline\r\n\r\n-usernames are currently only visible as lowercase, i’d like uppercase letters to render properly (the F in my name is uppercase) (by @fir)\r\n\r\n-banner display rework https:/\/darflen.com/posts/432731788828d47c2df32455\r\n__**Tags**__\r\n\r\n- Revert tag rounding and the popular tags section should be replaced with a trending tags section because seeing the same tags is redundant and repetitive \r\n\r\n-There should be a hashtag page with a filter (popular/loved/recent/viewed) where you can also search tags on it\r\n\r\n\r\n__**Quality of life**__\r\n\r\n~~-make the users online thing clickable and show all of the online users~~\r\n\r\n- Account switching \r\n\r\n-Last time online feature on profiles\r\n\r\n-Add a back button on the pages of a post so you don't have to scroll back to the post (suggestion by @69)\r\n\r\n- make it so mention in comments actually send a notification to the user mentioned \r\n-Infinite feeds  \r\n\r\n-Notification system rework where you can toggle notifications by hitting the bell 🔔 🔔 on someone's profile, also fix the issue of having multiple notifications for a single post\r\n\r\nwhen someone replies to you but the comment they reply to is also a reply you don’t get a notification (this seems to be intentional but is very annoying) (by @fir)\r\n\r\n-scroll bar for about me sections (communities and profiles) (by @fir)\r\n\r\n__**Features**__\r\n\r\n-friends and dm feature by @dagreenboi\r\nhttps:/\/darflen.com/posts/ffeaf720dc54353da60f236d\r\n\r\n-Post scheduling (by @coolkat)\r\n\r\n-horizontal line to posts ~~and a way to mention communities~~ (ADDED!!!)\r\n\r\n**Comment down suggestions you want and I will add them to this post**\r\n\r\n", "user": "jinx"}, {"id": "598f1859f2c1f2ad9b53699d", "content": "find the imposter

They are achieving absolutely nothing, and getting innocent accounts banned for absolutely nothing. Even if the account is old, and likely never going to come back, thats not the point. They have no way of telling if the account is going to come back. They are invading on the accounts privacy, as they have access to all of their personal information associated with scratch. They can see what their email is, and all of their unshaed projects, which is very bad and immoral. Especially since many users use the same password for a lot of things, and once you know the email, you could potentially find a lot of accounts on the internet with the same email, and hack into them as well. These accounts are also potentially active, which means it is worse when you get them banned. Even if you aren't doing these things when you pg, then it is an even more of a waste of time. You just hack into an account, do nothing, and say, 'oh look guys im really cool i have a 3 character account' and literally no one cares in the slightest. If not, people start to get annoyed. And I for one get very annoyed by this, people showing off that they managed to get rare accounts, because they put no effort into it at all. Their literally just running a script. And you should not be able to brag just for that. Also, 5 seconds later the account gets banned, and you don't have a 3 character account anymore. What do you do? Hack into another one. And then the process repeats over and over, until every 3 character account has been pged, and there is no hope for anyone, and it s all because of stupid pgers like ayd and marimo that ruined it for everyone. And then what will they do? They'll move on to 4 chars, and then 5 chars, and before you know it they start pging 20chars. And they'll be like 'Woah guys look I managed to get an account on scratch :0' and no body will care because no body uses scratch anymore. And then one day the final account will be pged, and scratch will be doomed. (not that I care about scratch either.) But for a lot of people, who, by now have become adults, and grew up with scratch, it will be very disappointing, that it was ruined by a couple of immature people breaking the terms of service. And even though I don't like scratch, I don't like that people like ayd and marimo think they get to do whatever they want, and don't care in the slightest about what other people think.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it's not wasting your time if you can get an account like @basketball or @ABCD, that's a really cool achievment, and the accounts aren't always banned. they almost always can't access the emails to old accounts. they usually don't care about the unshared projects either. the accounts are never active, and if they somehow were it would obviously be pged. also, most pgers don't use scripts. a lot of people care about pging, and it's not that easy to pg even using a script. also, it's not only 3 letters that get pged idiot, most of them have strong passwords or were locked by the st. also, @dp was obviously pged and not banned like many others, most 20chars aren't even made yet. at least 99% of accounts are almost impossible to pg. also, the original owners never return to scratch, so they won't be sad.\r\n\r\n@JamieD132, feel free to make hate comments against what i said. i want to know.", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "575ed5f5c46bfa7f757225e6", "content": "fuck darkpet found it", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "57b1185822b2799553293250", "content": "only 4 online users", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "57f1dcc8a0f51ddc89e9f2d6", "content": "so many new users :O", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "580e9eb0f25cee92ae55a9d4", "content": "Nice", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "5844c6fd5e2f814652bfa674", "content": "how to pass paradock in followers:\r\n1. post several times a day\r\n2. follow everyone\r\n3. post a lot of comments and try to be everywhere on darflen\r\n4. never go offline\r\n5. ask others to join darflen and they might follow you", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "594f8172752364de957a4e78", "content": "#darflenisbetterthanwasteof", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "5971067ac6f0baaa53e9ad98", "content": "here are some of the dumbest things in the world people said ----->", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "5b141c894fe6167bc8f5c82d", "content": "day 1 of trying to pg a 3 character scratch account", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "5cb79fb1a7f1abc3ef6eeee9", "content": "me and @avxq were facing opposite directions on the online page", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "5d5282a47a839a475927e3c2", "content": "12 users online!!! :D", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "5d996638b13df4d33be5225f", "content": "@paradock why did you ban @parad0ck but not @kcodarap", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "5f962254ee84887342375fa9", "content": "why is nobody else online", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "60c1474a55313dde3a310a01", "content": "guys let's replace 'yes' with 'big chungus' and 'no' with 'pecan pie' and 'the' with 'amongus'", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "616a67573231eb347d356b6a", "content": "when you make an anarchy community, darkpet is the last guy you want to see discovering them", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "61b9a2d08bd9f108842d8f99", "content": "vote for shqiper before it ends\r\n\r\n#sexydarflen2024", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "61bcaf10cbd49ebce0a104c4", "content": "why is everyone spamming", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "63d827278586b0536d011015", "content": "why does %darftube not get used much anymore?", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "6417602aea1e5f10ce69d224", "content": "vote for jcole!!!\r\n\r\n#sexydarflen2024", "user": "qxva"}, {"id": "57acf0f59e380cdab72919dc", "content": "Ratio", "user": "meems"}, {"id": "5d48a6d56a3bbb0ed213cb65", "content": "I promise you this isn't just messaging for #sexydarflen2024", "user": "shqiper"}, {"id": "598a99554624f286bc180b73", "content": "やっとパスワードリセットできた！！", "user": "kakeruzoku"}, {"id": "58869fe00c72757915064616", "content": "i swear if im gonna be banned because of wlodekm trolling me im about to blow\r\nthis drama be goofy af lol", "user": "barney86"}, {"id": "5be5aca9a1643f46a74d7fd7", "content": "ඞ", "user": "barney86"}, {"id": "6141595957426a7cad306337", "content": "god damn the beatles must've been experiencing some real bad times with this one\r\n\r\nnumber 9\r\nnumber 9\r\n\r\nthey'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower\r\n\r\nnumber 9\r\nnumber 9 ", "user": "barney86"}, {"id": "5e8386c73b1939115a545d76", "content": "video courtesy of theislander", "user": "thetys12"}, {"id": "63e99d533b2971fff2b36e2f", "content": "Good night", "user": "resisigu"}, {"id": "640997e45f44b67d900f9f23", "content": "It's been more than a month since I registered ! 🎉", "user": "resisigu"}, {"id": "61d133f78228d8a1b0c956ba", "content": "Meow?

Tesla descends into battery hell**\r\n\r\nElon Musk says prototypes are easy, production is hell. And when it comes to the long-awaited Cybertruck, Tesla's hell is its pioneering 4680 battery.\r\n\r\nTesla delivered the first of its futuristic stainless steel-plated electric pickups last month and CEO Musk said in October that it would probably hit an annual production rate of a quarter of a million vehicles at some point during 2025.\r\n\r\nBut Tesla is still a long way off that kind of production pace, and one of the main bottlenecks is the speed it can make the 4680 batteries used in the Cybertruck with its new dry-coating technology, nine people familiar with the matter said.\r\n\r\nTesla's Giga Texas factory is currently churning out 4680 battery cells at rate only sufficient to power about 24,000 Cybertrucks a year, or about a 10th of the required output, according to Reuters calculations based on a combination of public data and unpublished figures provided by sources.\r\n\r\nBeing able to ramp up battery output massively by dry-coating electrodes - rather than using the slower, more costly wet-coating - was a key factor behind Tesla's forecasts in 2020 that it would more than halve battery costs, cut investment significantly, and create smaller, greener factories.\r\n\r\nThe nine people, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Tesla had yet to crack dry-coating at the industrial scale needed to make 4680 batteries fast enough to hit its production targets.\r\n\r\nThe people said dry-coating the anode in the 4680 cells was not problematic but Tesla was struggling with the same technique for the cathode - the most expensive component in a battery.\r\n\r\nDry-coating anodes and cathodes is proven in the laboratory, as well as for smaller energy storage devices such as super capacitors, and even some small batteries, according to Yuan Gao, a battery technology consultant.\r\n\r\n'But no one has done it so far for large EV batteries at a mass scale and at a high enough speed. Tesla is the first one to try to commercialize this,' said Gao, who has worked in the industry for three decades.\r\n\r\n'The challenge is that not only does Tesla have to scale it up and speed up the process, it also must develop its own equipment and tools. It's daunting to say the least,' he said.\r\n\r\nTesla did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.\r\n\r\n**CRACKING THE CODE**\r\n\r\nAccording to three of the sources, the 4680 batteries in Cybertrucks include an estimated 1,360 individual cells.\r\n\r\nThat means Tesla would need to make 340 million cells a year, or almost a million a day, to supply 250,000 of the electric pickups, which are entering a hot market with rivals such as Ford's (F.N) F-150 Lightning, Rivian's (RIVN.O) R1T and an electric Hummer from General Motors (GM.N).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Tesla's Austin factory takes about 16 weeks to make 10 million 4680 cells, according to Reuters calculations based on figures from Tesla, verified by the three sources.\r\n\r\nThat translates to 32.5 million cells a year, or enough for just under 24,000 pickups - and that's only for the Cybertruck.\r\n\r\nTesla also wants to use 4680 batteries to power other vehicles, most notably the $25,000 small car the company is scrambling to launch by the mid-2020s.\r\n\r\nTesla has some limited production capacity for 4680 cells in Fremont, California but its plant there is mainly for pilot production. Panasonic (6752.T), one of Tesla's long-standing battery suppliers, is planning to build at least two plants in the United States but has only just broken ground on the first.\r\n\r\nTwo of the nine people familiar with the matter believe Tesla's progress with scaling up 4680 production will likely gain steam, especially once it achieves stability with the production know-how on one production line.\r\n\r\nThey said Tesla had been focusing on establishing robust know-how to produce batteries without flaws first time round. It's a time-consuming process but, 'once you crack the code and establish stability, it is like exponential', one of them said.\r\n\r\n'Speed would pick up. There is already a lot of traction in dry coating,' the person said.\r\n\r\nTesla's battery tsar Drew Baglino said in October that the company was now producing 4680 cells on two production lines in Austin and plans to install a total of eight lines there in two phases, with the last four due to be running in late 2024.\r\n\r\nStill, one of the two people said replicating established know-how from one production line to the next is no cakewalk.\r\n\r\nThe source said only about 5% of cells made on profitable production lines are ditched but scrap rates could shoot up to 30%-50% and hover there for several months as each new line gets going.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources said Tesla's dry-coating method for cathodes was not proving to be any faster than the old wet process, though scrap rates had dropped to as low as 10% to 20%.\r\nBaglino did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\r\n\r\n**'GOOEY MESS'**\r\n\r\nThe sources said Tesla was struggling to mix the cathode materials, which include lithium, manganese and nickel, with a binder and stick them to a metallic foil to produce a cathode - without using moisture.\r\n\r\nTwo of the people said the process worked for small amounts but when Tesla tried to scale it up, a lot of heat was generated and this melted the binder, which one of the sources believed was polytetrafluoroethylene, more commonly known as Teflon.\r\n\r\n'If you melt the glue, pretty soon everything will become one big chunk of gooey mess,' another of the sources said.\r\n\r\nEqually problematic for Tesla are the machines used to coat the metallic foil to produce battery electrodes - equipment which is akin to huge magazine and newspaper printing machines with large rollers, the sources said.\r\n\r\nTo accelerate cell production, Tesla is trying to coat multiple strips of magnetic foil with active battery materials at the same time, and at high speeds.\r\n\r\nThat calls for large, wide rollers, as well as applying tremendous force to press the materials onto the foil. But because the rollers are large and wide, applying pressure evenly is proving to be a challenge, the sources said.\r\n\r\nAnd when pressure is not applied evenly, Tesla gets electrodes with uneven surfaces and thickness, which are no use for its battery cells and need to be scrapped, the sources said.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more problematic, Tesla's Baglino told a fireside chat at a battery conference in March that Tesla was still building a completely new quality verification system so they could weed out cells with flaws in coating.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources with knowledge of the matter, said specifically it was about building data infrastructure around Tesla's battery development, manufacturing and in-field use because in some cases the flaws were hidden in the coating and did not show up for a few months down the road.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Tesla doesn't quite know yet which dry cells are good, and which ones need to be junked, the source said.\r\n\r\n#news #tesla REUTERS Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu", "user": "vision_media"}, {"id": "680e05811ccd50fdcd752869", "content": "school classes be like #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "6deedd36df5caff2561bf10a", "content": "~~trending~~ ai #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "6f0bb4a0314a44e667cf4cb2", "content": "#nightymorning", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "69ccc7fbc716009cc241c1a8", "content": "#memes", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "70a085e6fe55f1f7bd62e084", "content": "#meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "69f00e22c3a6f034b1694de2", "content": "this just pooped off my feed #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "6c9dd01f8a8843d8acf062e3", "content": "aliens #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "654221880a18be7b36475812", "content": "I putted grass seeds and fertilizer on my lawn\r\n\r\nnow what? time to wait for the rain to come in a few hours", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "6597905bf8043f428898dc81", "content": "what are your favorite foods?", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "66e0a1fb843ce6fdd1a494ee", "content": "we're stuck on the highway 😎", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "66f86d37bed8c74bc5cc940b", "content": "I think the explore page posts type and notifications are currently being a bit too crazy...", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "6706442d9db82ee913028d16", "content": "474269 remaining, I guess I can try it at 8am EST", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "67a0b776618e78ec7d644445", "content": "never check darflen cookies page on chromium based browsers\r\n\r\nit crashes lol", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "68a24b0525897462bff401ed", "content": "I still remember when I woke up and went on darflen for the fist time since the opening just to see a crap ton of activity\r\n\r\n250+ interactions was unimaginable for me at that time", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "692d4dee2411fdfe0c6f58c8", "content": "thanks @juancolacelli\r\n\r\nWhat is the best season?", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "6a7b9392656b5ccbeca24c0c", "content": "just testing a modified configuration for post image compression\r\n\r\nedit: this should have been posted in the etchbox community\r\nedit 2: yep, it works; on mobile, it is supposed to show a smaller resolution image and when you click on it, it shows the full res one", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "6b01563c956d80a270bec7c7", "content": "it's coming", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "6b1286745330f652202c54e8", "content": "It has ended...

They are achieving absolutely nothing, and getting innocent accounts banned for absolutely nothing. Even if the account is old, and likely never going to come back, thats not the point. They have no way of telling if the account is going to come back. They are invading on the accounts privacy, as they have access to all of their personal information associated with scratch. They can see what their email is, and all of their unshared projects, which is very bad and immoral. Especially since many users use the same password for a lot of things, and once you know the email, you could potentially find a lot of accounts on the internet with the same email, and hack into them as well. These accounts are also potentially active, which means it is worse when you get them banned. Even if you aren't doing these things when you pg, then it is an even more of a waste of time. You just hack into an account, do nothing, and say, 'oh look guys im really cool i have a 3 character account' and literally no one cares in the slightest. If not, people start to get annoyed. And I for one get very annoyed by this, people showing off that they managed to get rare accounts, because they put no effort into it at all. Their literally just running a script. And you should not be able to brag just for that. Also, 5 seconds later the account gets banned, and you don't have a 3 character account anymore. What do you do? Hack into another one. And then the process repeats over and over, until every 3 character account has been pged, and there is no hope for anyone, and it s all because of stupid pgers like ayd and marimo that ruined it for everyone. And then what will they do? They'll move on to 4 chars, and then 5 chars, and before you know it they start pging 20chars. And they'll be like 'Woah guys look I managed to get an account on scratch :0' and no body will care because no body uses scratch anymore. And then one day the final account will be pged, and scratch will be doomed. (not that I care about scratch either.) But for a lot of people, who, by now have become adults, and grew up with scratch, it will be very disappointing, that it was ruined by a couple of immature people breaking the terms of service. And even though I don't like scratch, I don't like that people like ayd and marimo think they get to do whatever they want, and don't care in the slightest about what other people think.", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "68f50593e3378e43f8c77460", "content": "i would 100% give @paradock my email and password so he can figure out why me and jamie can make ownerless commuites", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "693852a949a9a3e1603aee56", "content": "Bro..", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6959cc4f66b7239bcc940bc4", "content": "Earthbound Screenshot 💀💀💀", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "695aad96f5538a16d70c8a84", "content": "Real", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "698f3e8f033d90bc51aaf768", "content": "Man, what did I do for all my posts to be Pregnant polytrack car and 504 notifications?????", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "698f924c52a51c473da0d46f", "content": "JamieD132 Hat Lore:\r\n\r\nIn the land of cheese women wear hats but not the men the reason Jamie wears a women's hat is because at a young age his mother left him and left her hat with him and he wears it as a memory of her. \r\n\r\nThe other hat is him being a femboy ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6994c4b876aa8d92b1c2a199", "content": "__***~~Fun~~ Love Fact Time***__\r\n\r\n@cheesewhisk3rs is the most **loved** user \r\n\r\nWhen I mean loved i mean most loves... sorry cheesewhisk3rs \r\n\r\nSecond in most loves is @MrMeems", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6a5e871355e25cf7d91986bb", "content": "Drippy MeemNein", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6acd538e0c95e828873c06da", "content": "", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6af2c1e4486a1e2047e294fe", "content": "following yourself got patched, nooooooooo", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6b55034ef1b78ca5b832a659", "content": "Custom themes \r\n\r\nMidnight isn't dark enough \r\n\r\nDARKNESS MORE DARKNESS ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6b8119bdb678d45e5b94e2f5", "content": "", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6bea3b2a20f969c4538a5ffb", "content": "So confidently too 💀", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6bf461b166b29d4b607603c6", "content": "Gilbert", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6c052cfc467b87d6509e6735", "content": "I let my brother use my computer for 1 second and he downloaded opera and 40 anti-viruses and has spent a hour trying to remove them", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6c30283fada9bd707f4c9b43", "content": "My school blocked midiano noooooooo", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6c6d65375789b62e6c9b15de", "content": "There Are Two Types of nicknames ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6cc10061e79ce32c047fe8ed", "content": "Gay", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6ce1d3d63957c1f420e00c7b", "content": "We should be able to repost posts from outside of communities in communities\r\n\r\nparadock ratio", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6ceda14a5e0bd73d8943f867", "content": "Boing", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6d01b363859883205816a044", "content": "@201 is gonna be angry when they realize there account is banned ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6d29988b1d03d4d40c2c6345", "content": "My account could have been sold for millions bur for some reason I got unfollowed from myself ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6d5170d4a907ecb8036049ea", "content": "Sleped for 6 hours without stopping ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6d5d424205ce969d774e5a28", "content": "Comment on this post without viewing it", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6d9ca39208323637d418d62f", "content": "ayd went into furry mode", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6ddc8664855f7a8998498e1c", "content": "God dammit I'm Andy again ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6df60b16734fb9aec07b7089", "content": "The massive security issue with directmessaging is crazy", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6e048c7c539ba3dcb7095d87", "content": "Brainrot Maxxing ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6e0ae4804213d56b61831419", "content": "@Andy Lore https:/\/youtube.com/shorts/m5_fd6RPPpg?feature=share", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6e12fe4c9ec29c840c87c3c5", "content": "u can js die ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6e1e8a16221b0b6d93c68994", "content": "", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6e326cf638297f02c22a5706", "content": "Weezer", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6e4c56d1dadc5d20d6320572", "content": "gonna restart the chain from the last savepoint", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6e4e743d01471b58023287ea", "content": "      ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6e561a0b74fb948f816b3429", "content": "At least were united by one thing", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6ed9045f0119581ce6ea1123", "content": "Had to wait until the last moment ", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6ef044104b86c843db226680", "content": "https:/\/turbowarp.org/873016820/fullscreen join me", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6f8ee8b6565030d8e1aed75a", "content": "@cmd i might try the fast strat later", "user": "MrMeems"}, {"id": "6ff32c9cc4a2c20a4594ea00", "content": "Uh, the meematronic here does get a bit quirky at night but do I blame him?

The incredibly low prices of consumer goods on the website may be due to the fact that all goods are shipped directly from China’s factories and warehouses. Since the first day it was released, Temu has been receiving nothing but endless praise and gaining customers day by day. However, some people are criticizing Temu saying that their orders arrived a lot later than the estimated delivery time and the products are lower quality than expected. \r\n\r\nA number of people are saying that their items never arrived, or took weeks or even months to arrive. Temu currently has 1,199 reviews and an average rating of three stars on TrustPilot Reviews, an online review community of people that brings businesses and consumers together while using genuine feedback from customers.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why Temu is able to keep all the products at extremely low prices is that it has a way to send customer feedback back to manufacturers, which notifies them of the specific products that customers want and when they need to produce sought-after or high-demand products. Not only are all products sold at affordable prices, but Temu also offers discounts and gives out free items as long as you promote the app and encourage friends and families to sign up.\r\n\r\nUnlike shopping brands like Shein, Temu is said to be environmentally ethical considering that their goal isn’t for millions and billions of apparel to eventually end up in landfills. Since its focus isn’t particularly stay on top of fashion trends, Temu is able to lessen waste by determining customers’ desired products. \r\n\r\nThis isn’t always the case, however, with reviews of people saying that the products are not at all good quality, with some of the items in such bad condition that they’re impossible to use. However, Temu offers $5 credit for packages bought with shipping that arrived later than expected. \r\n\r\n“This is an interesting example of the manufacturing base in China getting sufficiently sophisticated that it no longer feels it needs to go through distributors,” Douglas Schmidt, a professor of computer science at Vanderbilt University states.“They’re selling directly to consumers. And there are a lot of people who are hurting economically and looking for a bargain.”\r\n\r\nWith the takeover of this e-commerce website, how will this impact the future of other American companies and websites? If more and more people flock to Temu to buy products and fewer people are on other shopping sites like Amazon, it would increase the pressure on those websites. There’s a possibility that they might start lowering their prices as well, following the success of Temu to attract more customers to their websites.\r\n\r\nTemu may be taking over the world now, but who knows what will happen in the future? With more and more advances in technology and society, the success that Temu is experiencing right now isn’t 100% guaranteed. This e-commerce website may give rise to other companies in the future to better suit consumers’ needs and desires. Whether you use it or not, the impact it has on the world is noticeable.", "user": "temu"}, {"id": "8a6a89dfa594bde6e3637d7d", "content": "", "user": "germany"}, {"id": "837798ec0b9100c9a9aafaa8", "content": "Impostor", "user": "ayd"}, {"id": "87cd15bd4f034c1ba37e9f89", "content": "what?

However, over time, Mr. Sorn was viewed less as an unstoppable force to be dreaded and more someone to face fearlessly and overcome. This may have been started by Geoffrey Baye. The original text cannot be found, but he is quoted to have once wrote this:\r\n'I've met a bevy of folks who whimper and run at the sight of Mr. Sorn, even though they know well that by abandoning ship that they are giving him free rein to rummage and pilfer through all of your most treasured possessions. You cannot leave dealing with Mr. Sorn up to chance, as he is chance himself, and he clearly does you no favors. You must deal with him yourself, as scary as that might be, but as long as you have choice and the ability to take opportunities, Mr. Sorn can do nothing to you.'\r\n\r\n~~I think half of that is useless nonsense but the other half I agree with~~", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "8e7df47aef966dcf706e3c27", "content": "First #nightymorning in a while", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "8efaf1b9faaa7e5a0fccfab7", "content": "That's hopefully going to be my last post about anything Eustace and/or Excelsius Winner related", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "8f581893fa6e9c321c12f30e", "content": "https:/\/darflen.com/posts/a425976d496a51d6b2f280c1\r\ni've managed to figure out how to make an actually functioning poll that doesn't erase the explore page B)", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "90bd2d7334e4c6103d13b598", "content": "", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "919aed15b3bcd03ba5375742", "content": "https:/\/www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjOndL4eZDRHj1OqNN6Pk4VluBjHnit5E\r\n\r\nShuffle, listen to the first 5 you get, rank them", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "92bff402ea51f0ad615cea0f", "content": "i made a 24 hour mp3 file to test if darflen supported it and i don't think it does\r\nbut now i just have a 24 hour mp3 file just sitting here so does anyone want it and if so how would i give it to you\r\nit's just a bunch of 1's and 2's that form this sequence: https:/\/oeis.org/A000002", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "92e6574286801becdd483339", "content": "As a menber of the #eulgeater council, no it hasn't.

They are achieving absolutely nothing, and getting innocent accounts banned for absolutely nothing. Even if the account is old, and likely never going to come back, thats not the point. They have no way of telling if the account is going to come back. They are invading on the accounts privacy, as they have access to all of their personal information associated with scratch. They can see what their email is, and all of their unshared projects, which is very bad and immoral. Especially since many users use the same password for a lot of things, and once you know the email, you could potentially find a lot of accounts on the internet with the same email, and hack into them as well. These accounts are also potentially active, which means it is worse when you get them banned. Even if you aren't doing these things when you pg, then it is an even more of a waste of time. You just hack into an account, do nothing, and say, 'oh look guys im really cool i have a 3 character account' and literally no one cares in the slightest. If not, people start to get annoyed. And I for one get very annoyed by this, people showing off that they managed to get rare accounts, because they put no effort into it at all. Their literally just running a script. And you should not be able to brag just for that. Also, 5 seconds later the account gets banned, and you don't have a 3 character account anymore. What do you do? Hack into another one. And then the process repeats over and over, until every 3 character account has been pged, and there is no hope for anyone, and it s all because of stupid pgers like ayd and marimo that ruined it for everyone. And then what will they do? They'll move on to 4 chars, and then 5 chars, and before you know it they start pging 20chars. And they'll be like 'Woah guys look I managed to get an account on scratch :0' and no body will care because no body uses scratch anymore. And then one day the final account will be pged, and scratch will be doomed. (not that I care about scratch either.) But for a lot of people, who, by now have become adults, and grew up with scratch, it will be very disappointing, that it was ruined by a couple of immature people breaking the terms of service. And even though I don't like scratch, I don't like that people like ayd and marimo think they get to do whatever they want, and don't care in the slightest about what other people think.", "user": "cheesewhisk3rs"}, {"id": "9dff9cbc203aa1a2bee60171", "content": "I refused Monieton P.

It would be impossible to change a deleted acc profile without ST or something.\r\nAnd he even changed his profile on ayd's acc (@96961) which is banned. Even if he could get into the account he would not be able to do these things.\r\nAlso, the -retex- pw was powerful. It is almost impossible to pging such acc.\r\nAnd I've never seen him change anything other than pfp and bio on his pg'd accounts.\r\nAnd the activity is still clean.\r\nIf he don't want people to find out that your account has been pg'd, you wouldn't bother to put it in your profile.\r\n\r\nSo how did you change the bio or whatever?\r\nI don't know either, but they must have exploited some vulnerability.\r\nTeacher accounts can change the bio and pfp of their own student accounts\r\n\r\nThis is all we can speculate on at this time.

Let them. But we will do it based on our national interests,' Putin told a meeting of the defence leadership in Moscow.\r\n\r\n'We will not give up what is ours,' Putin said, adding that Russia did not intend to fight with Europe.\r\n\r\nRussia controls about 17.5% of the territory that was internationally recognised as part of Ukraine when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\r\n\r\nRussia annexed Crimea in 2014, and last year said the four additional regions of Ukraine that its troops partially control are part of Russia. Kyiv says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from Ukraine.\r\n\r\n**RUSSIA AT WAR**\r\n\r\nPutin spoke at a meeting of the defence ministry which was attended by the military top brass, including Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, as well as Federal Security Service (FSB) Director Alexander Bortnikov.\r\n\r\nRussian troops, Putin said, now had the initiative on the battlefield.\r\n\r\n'We are not going to abandon the goals of the special military operation,' Putin said, though he added that Russia needed better military communication, reconnaissance, targeting and satellite capability.\r\n\r\nHe said Russia's defence industry was responding faster than that of the West and said Russia would continue to upgrade its nuclear forces and keep its combat readiness at a high level.\r\n\r\nRussia's production of tanks has increased since February 2022 by 5.6 times, unmanned aerial vehicles by 16.8 times and artillery shells by 17.5 times, Shoigu said.\r\n\r\nHe said Russia had taken on 490,000 contract and voluntary soldiers in 2023. Next year, Russia will try to boost that contracted force to 745,000 men.\r\n\r\nRussian forces have laid 7,000 km of minefields in Ukraine - some up to 600 metres wide, along with 1.5 million anti-tank barriers and 2,000 km of anti-tank ditches, Shoigu said.\r\n\r\nPutin said Ukrainian membership of NATO 'is not acceptable for Russia in 10 years, and not in 20'.\r\n\r\n#news *REUTERS by By Guy Faulconbridge*", "user": "vision_media"}, {"id": "b5532bc1088740ea5f4760db", "content": "apple #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "b3704a18cd0b4ea5125f5117", "content": "2024 #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "b4ce2b0eb3dca45db61c1fbb", "content": "damn, it was a mistake on my side\r\n\r\nsomeone kicked fir from a community and because of the mistake, it kicked him from every communities instead of the one that someone decided to\r\n\r\n#grammar #code", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "ad9e8b07c6330bdf4a7e7707", "content": "#nightymorning 10 minutes too late", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "b14b5e8e087d84504f39814b", "content": "2024 is a crazy year for youtube #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "aee0d800ad62b091d006b1cc", "content": "#meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "afdbd7fccc63ef7576c149c0", "content": "thank you for not littering #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "b476a80c97ce3fdc7c76874b", "content": "#archives more very OG Darflen", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "aca457d83ca62c39a2b66e18", "content": "true or false #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "ab1ee1c0d70d277a0e6f27d9", "content": "~~force~~ invite @coolkat to join back darflen", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "ab2a1def91eaec022392537b", "content": "darflen day is august 7th aka when I started working on Darflen :)", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "ab48859a7e4051fc3ffbc574", "content": "#eulgeater pretty much died here", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "ab8daa83651ec40808fa6c6f", "content": "why are you sending so many posts about the same thing...", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "abf185b606312db9fd4c8150", "content": "from a sore throat to a runny nose, now I have an headache", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "ac67e4dab41365bdcc3e2840", "content": "me currently trying to handle the #blaze\r\n\r\n(what is happening)", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "ad18c2990fef79bbb58ee2a6", "content": "look at that:\r\n\r\nthe human eye is 98% water according to the NIH (.gov)\r\nthe blood is 50% water according to google\r\n\r\nyeah, don't poke at your eye\r\n", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "adf6db11cbaf20c45a4901c6", "content": "anyways, I am still working on revamping some code on Darflen (and that also include the blocking feature, search and permissions)", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "ae2e3d0bcadaba1fca3ae825", "content": "guys, my clock is stuck at 3PM on my taskbar\r\n\r\nwhat do I do", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "ae3d001b237639753eba65ad", "content": "ok, what should I do now?", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "aecbd83d3ec5ec21c2438b4d", "content": "I keep misreading cheesewhisk3rs as cheese wicker", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "aecc47f7e7669d595a50bf40", "content": "'wake up!' said the weather app 'the sun goes up by 6:13!'\r\n\r\nno", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "afa00c475828fbbbb77e39e1", "content": "What order do you for putting water?

You have equally as much power as I do, I'm just the one using it.

There are other people around, maybe trying to change your surroundings for the better in some obvious way I've managed to miss somehow affects others negatively? I manage to convince myself of a *lot* of obviously wrong things often (all it takes is any form of anger at all, this is why I say there are others who could do better for the surroundings than I can), so I have to be careful about those, and this is one of those things I want to be careful about. But unlike those, I don't even have a **hint** as to where this could be wrong, so this path of thought has been stuck at the beginning for *months* now.

What sets BlockCoin apart is the BlockCoins—our built-in currency system. It’s not just another social media platform; it’s a place where you can earn, trade, and spend within the community itself. You can actually get creative with how you use BlockCoins, whether it's rewarding content, exchanging for cool stuff, or even creating your own mini-economy! That’s something you won’t find anywhere else.\r\n\r\nI know there are bugs, and I’m really sorry for the issues. I’ll be honest—I’m still learning and don’t have all the knowledge to fix everything right away. But I’m constantly working to improve, and I appreciate your patience as I work through it.\r\n\r\nRather than focusing on what’s not working, I’d love if you could focus on the creative, working, cool parts of BlockCoin.\r\n\r\nFor those who’ve been critical, like @qxva or @cheesewhisk3rs: I understand, it has lots of bugs, but BlockCoin is really important to me.

Considering you can pin a post by anyone, and it doesn’t even need to be in your community, this basically gave the people who knew about the exploit power over everyone else. Before knowing this, I panicked and deleted my post and changed my password thinking I was being hacked. But then @blockcoinisbetter told me about the exploit and he went on to edit a Darflen post to make it say Darflen had commited 63 felonies, while I edited a jcole post to contain the #meow hashtag (after getting permission). I forgot what I did apart delete a few blaze alt posts for testing, and change 1 word of s4il’s pinned post.\r\n\r\nJust before the website gets taken down for maintance [*sic*], @blockcoinisbetter manages to change s4il’s pinned post to “hi, im gay” and then wiped every single post by @Darflen.\r\n\r\nAfter Darflen was accessible again, the functions to edit and delete pinned posts no longer worked. Paradock probably added checking to see who was deleting posts afterward (I hope he did).\r\n\r\nThe aftermath of c2pe, which only lasted 2 hours or so, brought the most users who edited a single post record (me, blockcoinisbetter, Paradock, s4il in that order), a little bit of peace on the blockcoin war and temp ban (@blockcoinisbetter). Sometime short after or before, Paradock also deleted the original place of the discovery of the exploit, the s4il hate community. It’s probably better that way.\r\n\r\nNext time: anarchy/ownerless communities.\r\nDisclaimer: Info may not be 100% accurate, I went off of a few posts from the chaos period (a lot of them were deleted afterward), screenshots and memory.", "user": "cheesewhisk3rs"}, {"id": "ce2fefbe22462e1487a6c096", "content": "i’m not going to make it to #/nightymorning\r\nso\r\n#meow this is a good song https:/\/www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gY0k0alnZ0", "user": "cheesewhisk3rs"}, {"id": "c95523ad7bba966b49d3f2a7", "content": "#DAILYREMINDER to watch this masterpiece https:/\/www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdZ9xEPY8z4", "user": "cheesewhisk3rs"}, {"id": "d06f95d36c0cf29ed9cd5d15", "content": "#meow Some bad things have come of the internet, but some good too.

a legitimate online marketplace. Phishing emails are fraudulent letters crafted by scammers with the intention of deceiving unsuspecting recipients into divulging their personal information.\r\n\r\nThis phishing email bears the subject line 'Attn: Please confirm your shipping-address' and purports to be related to a pending shipment from Temu. The email includes a section emphasizing a 'PENDING PACKAGE DELIVERY' and urges the recipient to schedule the delivery by subscribing to push notifications.\r\n\r\nIt provides a tracking code, TEM1539820X8 (it may vary), and encourages the recipient to schedule the delivery to avoid similar issues in the future. However, the entire content is deceptive, designed by malicious actors to trick recipients into interacting with the email and disclosing sensitive personal information.\r\n\r\nWhen the 'Schedule your delivery' button is clicked, a page is opened displaying a fabricated shipping history map along with a prompt to click the 'Confirm' button for message access. Upon clicking 'Confirm', users are prompted to respond to a series of questions and subsequently redirected to a phishing page where they are asked to enter personal information.\r\n\r\nOn that webpage, users are asked to furnish information, including their first and last name, address, postal code, city, phone number, and email address. It is probable that this page also prompts individuals to disclose their credit card details.\r\n\r\nScammers exploit the acquired personal information for various malicious purposes. They may engage in identity theft, using the gathered details to impersonate the victim and commit fraudulent activities. With stolen credit card details, scammers can make unauthorized purchases.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, scammers often sell the stolen information on the dark web, contributing to a thriving underground market for personal data.\r\n\r\nIt is crucial to note that the initial page accessed through the link in the phishing email seeks permission to display notifications. Granting permission for notifications on that page may lead to an influx of deceptive advertisements, directing users to identical or similar scams and fraudulent websites.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, emails of this kind share common traits such as deceptive subject lines, urgent calls to action, requests for personal information, and often contain spelling or grammar errors. They aim to manipulate recipients into divulging sensitive data or clicking on malicious links by creating a sense of urgency or importance.\r\n\r\nTrusting such emails can lead to various issues, including identity theft, financial fraud, unauthorized access to personal accounts, and the compromise of sensitive information.", "user": "temu"}, {"id": "d100c1c98c67a4f32dddf39d", "content": "say my name out loud (paradock i'm not a namesnipe, i will use this account sometimes)", "user": "moderated_e8192"}, {"id": "c907b8a226c7295b806f4c05", "content": "get to 5 votes in 10 minutes starting now\r\n\r\nedit: WE REACHED IT", "user": "rfnjgrinjfujgniiitjnhue"}, {"id": "c88bbf510ec90a6c46e2f9fc", "content": "The three consecutive holidays are over.....", "user": "-ninzinkun"}, {"id": "cbdfe5fe73aae0be265c1ebf", "content": "happy x)", "user": "-ninzinkun"}, {"id": "cea0f828d560fca432a4cffa", "content": "My logo uses the golden ratio.", "user": "-ninzinkun"}, {"id": "cd533bfd674be326ab815f63", "content": "ralsei is cool", "user": "alex"}, {"id": "d12372f6334fe1944da92671", "content": "やば、ログインしてなかった\r\n\r\nOh, I didn't log in.", "user": "_-peking-_"}, {"id": "d2f1f347fe2a4b9cd98559bf", "content": "Hello guys!

Several of the biggest boxship owners—A.P. Moller-Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd, MSC and CMA CGM—have also decided to divert some ships.xa0\r\n\r\nThe three big shipping alliances, made up of the world’s top 10 boxship players, have issued a “pending” notice on Red Sea routes, meaning ships are asked to drift or divert on a case-by-case basis. On average there are 17 boxships crossing the Suez Canal daily. Brokers say it is now around 14, but the Suez Canal says traffic is normal.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between Israel and Hamas had, until now, barely interrupted global flows of crude and cargo beyond halting small volumes shipped in and out of Israel. Oil was still sailing through the Red Sea on Monday.\r\n\r\nAfter BP’s withdrawal, traders and brokers said they were concerned that other major shipping and trading companies could follow suit. For the world economy, disruption to shipping in the Middle East would compound a slowdown in transit through the Panama Canal due to low water levels.\r\n\r\nIf the Red Sea becomes a no-go zone for most tankers, it would redraw the global oil market for the second time in two years after the war on Ukraine and related sanctions forced Russia to find new markets for its petroleum. That could send oil prices and tanker rates vaulting higher, said Richard Matthews, research director at E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers.\r\n\r\n“All you know is it is going to cause chaos, and everything is going to get a lot more expensive,” he said. As of Monday morning, Matthews said most tanker companies were still willing to send their vessels through the shipping chokepoint, preventing a jump in prices.\r\n\r\nBrent crude futures, the global benchmark, rose 2.5% to about $78 a barrel in Monday trading. The cost of chartering tankers in the region also edged up as shipowners looked to pass on higher insurance costs to traders renting their boats. That gave a boost to shares of tanker owners including Frontline and Tsakos Energy, which rose about 3% and 4%, respectively, in U.S. trading.\r\n\r\n“It’s becoming more serious so we are diverting some tankers,” said Lars Barstad, the chief executive of Norway-based Frontline. “The escort force will be very much welcome. It will make passages slow significantly but it will be much safer.”\r\n\r\nThe Red Sea separates Africa from the Middle Eastern Gulf, and is bookended by Egypt’s Suez Canal to the north and Bab el-Mandeb to the south. Those two straits, combined with the Sumed pipeline running through Egypt, accounted for 12% of all the oil that traded by sea in the first half of 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. About 8% of the world’s trade in liquefied-natural gas also passes through those routes.\r\n\r\nThe Houthi group said in mid-November that it would target Israeli ships, and this month said it would widen that threat to prevent the passage of all ships to Israel if more humanitarian aid isn’t allowed into Gaza. Houthi forces have attacked vessels that have no association with Israel, maritime security firm Ambrey said in a note to clients late last week. The firm also said that instability in northern Somalia was raising the risk of piracy in the region.\r\n\r\nOil traders said a major drop in the number of tankers sailing through the Red Sea would affect the market in refined products such as diesel and gasoline more than the market in crude. That is because Europe has imported refined fuels in huge volumes from the Middle East and India since it stopped most shipments from Russia at the start of this year.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Russian crude and fuel that once got bought by refiners in Europe now sails through the Red Sea to buyers in India, China and other fast-growing Asian markets. Mark Esposito, an analyst at commodities-data firm S&P Global, said daily southbound flows through the Suez Canal have risen by about 1.5 million barrels to 4.7 million barrels a day this year, while northbound volumes are up by about 300,000 barrels daily to 3.5 million.\r\n\r\nFor shipowners and the companies that charter their vessels, there are both reputational and financial dangers associated with sailing through a region where boats have been attacked. The biggest crude carriers hold more than $150 million in oil at current Brent prices.\r\n\r\nInsurance premiums have gone up but not so high that there is a clear financial incentive to sail the long way around Africa, said Mike Salthouse, head of external affairs at NorthStandard, a U.K.-based insurer.\r\n\r\nStill ship companies have a long history of operating in war zones where they can charge more money for their services. When international ships were attacked in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, tanker owners kept sailing through the region.\r\n\r\n“There are about 10 ships drifting on the North entrance of the canal—ships heading from Europe to Asia—as they assess the situation,” said Peter Sand, chief analyst at shipping platform Xeneta. “Geopolitics is showing its ugly face and shipping has been taken as a hostage.” \r\n\r\n#news *The Wall Street Journal*", "user": "vision_media"}, {"id": "df76fd3106fd91874ab2167d", "content": "darflen", "user": "vision_media"}, {"id": "d66b75ad14c9319de3eabb81", "content": "may my #nightymorning help me for my french and english exams today", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "dd25d1aaae2189c0d484c942", "content": "#meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "d46ef18b663d866aee44b5ae", "content": "modern games #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "d62e7b1ec25a3f4e69cd55ab", "content": "jinx sleep #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "d9c4a24f0c7bda6c99985f17", "content": "#nightymorning", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "df1aa48e3b95094796a4fc03", "content": "2024 is the year #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "dee6efa1fb054d389b695c42", "content": "spicy #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "db9550d6365b7d9240def239", "content": "you can gain this skill #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "dfd05fccf4c9db46ece63314", "content": "brain #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "dd07b1c4b75a072eed68a2b2", "content": "mine is ~16 #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "dfde599d5c8e7b20c0314cc3", "content": "me #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "e0028958c96bffa92b45bbae", "content": "cats #meme", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "d3a3aa6c2f25eba05d7293f7", "content": "I need to find more bugs, there's definitely many more hidden in plain sight", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "d41486e743743276597a14e7", "content": "when I searched 'Darflen' on Youtube, meems tutorial to make an ownerless community is the first result lol", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "d4eecb3007e96b15821310dd", "content": "what are you doing darkpet loving every posts I made", "user": "paradock"}, {"id": "d52ba3e12067895a7235892d", "content": "'It's time to make Darflen great again!

Despite these risks, hydrogen hydroxide is commonly used as an industrial solvent, used as a coolant in nuclear power plants, used as a flame retardant, and used as an additive to unhealthy foods.

As we approach the upcoming election, we find ourselves at a crossroads—a moment that will shape our collective destiny. It is not merely a choice between candidates; it is a choice between divergent paths, each leading to a distinct future.\r\n\r\nOur country faces challenges—economic disparities, climate change, and social divisions—that demand bold solutions. But let us not forget our shared values: liberty, justice, and the pursuit of happiness. These ideals bind us together, transcending party lines and personal interests.\r\n\r\nI pledge to lead with integrity, transparency, and compassion. My administration will prioritize education, healthcare, and job creation. We will invest in renewable energy, protect our environment, and foster innovation. Together, we will build bridges, not walls—bridges that connect communities, hearts, and minds.\r\n\r\nIn this election, let us rise above negativity and embrace unity. Let us listen to one another, recognizing that diversity is our strength. As we cast our ballots, let us remember the sacrifices of those who fought for our right to vote. Let us honor their legacy by participating in this sacred democratic process.\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens, the power lies with you. Your vote is not just a mark on a ballot; it is a voice echoing through history. Choose wisely, for our children and grandchildren will inherit the consequences of our decisions.\r\n\r\nThank you, and may darflen thrive.

Depending on what the first symbol is, a different production is appended to the end, then the first *m* symbols are removed. If the string is empty, it halts. There are slight differences in this definition depending on what's convenient, but the main idea of appending and removing stays the same.\r\nm=2 is known to be Turing-complete and is, as far as I know, the most oftenly used value of m. If you inspect any m=2 tag system, you'll notice that not only is data stored in the symbols themselves, but also in the even/odd-ness of their positions. For example, take this Collatz example:\r\n```\r\na -> bc\r\nb -> a\r\nc -> aaa\r\n```\r\nLet's run this with the starting string being aaaaa. (the --'s are just for spacing)\r\n```\r\naaaaa\r\n--aaabc\r\n----abcbc\r\n------cbcbc\r\n--------cbcaaa\r\n----------caaaaaa\r\n------------aaaaaaaa\r\n```\r\nBecause the amount of a's was odd, it skipped over the b, and only ran the c's. Now let's continue.\r\n```\r\naaaaaaaa\r\n--aaaaaabc\r\n----aaaabcbc\r\n------aabcbcbc\r\n--------bcbcbcbc\r\n----------bcbcbca\r\n------------bcbcaa\r\n--------------bcaaa\r\n----------------aaaa\r\n```\r\nSince it was even this time, the b's ran and skipped over the c's. 'bc' acts as a single unit that does different things depending on the parity of the a's.\r\nIt also helps to think of tag systems in terms of generations, starting with the initial string (e.g. aaaaa) to the string generated by the initial string (e.g. cbcbc) to the string generated by that (e.g. aaaaaaaa) etc. A better example for this kind of thing is UT19, which is split into three separate generations forming a single cycle. The specifics of what UT19 accomplishes will not be noted here.\r\nAs an example, here are two 'inverters', which are used to flip the parity from even to odd and odd to even during the Command generation:\r\n```\r\nRelevant productions:\r\na -> bc\r\nb -> dd\r\nc -> rd\r\nd -> aas\r\nr -> r\r\ns -> (nothing)\r\n\r\naasaas (Command generation)\r\n--saasbc\r\n----asbc\r\n------bcbc (Parity generation)\r\n--------bcdd\r\n----------dddd (Reset generation)\r\n------------ddaas\r\n--------------aasaas (Command generation)\r\n```\r\nMore complicated parts of UT19 change every cycle, such as the counters. They can either double or halve their length each generation:\r\n```\r\nRelevant productions:\r\na -> bc\r\nb -> dd\r\nc -> rd\r\nd -> aas\r\nl -> nnnn\r\nm -> o\r\nn -> pp\r\no -> pq\r\np -> lm\r\nq -> llll\r\nr -> r\r\ns -> (nothing)\r\n\r\nlmlm (Command generation)\r\n--lmnnnn\r\n----nnnnnnnn (Parity generation)\r\n------nnnnnnpp\r\n--------nnnnpppp\r\n----------nnpppppp\r\n------------pppppppp (Reset generation)\r\n--------------pppppplm\r\n----------------pppplmlm\r\n------------------pplmlmlm\r\n--------------------lmlmlmlm (Command generation)\r\n\r\n(The parity each generation is entered is important, so two inverters are used)\r\naaslmlmaas (Command)\r\n--slmlmaasbc\r\n----mlmaasbc\r\n------maasbco\r\n--------asbcoo\r\n----------bcoobc (Parity)\r\n------------oobcdd\r\n--------------bcddpq\r\n----------------ddpqdd (Reset)\r\n------------------pqddaas\r\n--------------------ddaaslm\r\n----------------------aaslmaas (Command)\r\n```\r\n(In case you're wondering about the reason for the q symbol or what happens when you halve lm, those are involved with a more complicated component, and are the reason behind the name of the 'Reset' generation.)\r\n\r\nThis will only be the first in a series of posts, with the next one covering Cyclic tag. #meow", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "ff45f4c99f34849684ab3cf0", "content": "I won Daily Squardle #933 with 7 guesses to spare!\r\nWord found after 5 guesses:\r\n🟩🟩🟩🟩🟥\r\n⬛🔳🟩🔳⬛\r\n🟥🟥🟩🟨🟩\r\n🟩🔳🟩🔳⬛\r\n⬛🟩🟩⬛⬛\r\nhttps:/\/fubargames.se/squardle/\r\n\r\nThat was the most ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ one I've done", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "fdf5a536704f3ad360e4cf9b", "content": "#nightymorning September 12->13\r\n\r\ni swear if this post gets a double-digit amount of loves", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "fcd6cbe9816b249e262e48a7", "content": "Why has nobody made a breader yet\r\nThat would be cool", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "fd697e603c2624a6b2765b9b", "content": "Which of these names is better\r\nNo extra context, just which is better", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "fe3064f6e147556168ae5d63", "content": ".svgz cannot be uploaded on darflen, I tried\r\n\r\nEdit: .rm doesn't work either", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "fe778e900e8495dd55d1dfaf", "content": "How many syllables is 'gsralnsk'?", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "ff06f5e2c740063de6d25581", "content": "do you think we're gonna find it ||/j||\r\nhttps:/\/www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk-YOFZK0ro", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "ff104bdc07e1075b863a850e", "content": "wow that's *weird*\r\nokay now on with my daily squardle", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "ff5bb81068ab125692e6e717", "content": "Read this read this read this *read this **read this __READ THIS__***\r\nhttps:/\/tinyurl.com/fpr4tfa6\r\nIf I never saw this I would've almost certainly eventually written something just like this except worse and with *much* less examples", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "ff7d9f11e0be11c829d8dfe6", "content": "first poll!", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "ffafee82b2d6eb019fa15080", "content": "Not as tall as I wanted it to be (I was hoping for 4294967295 pixels tall, but I went with 65535 instead) but good enough", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "ffcf81f3a827769016635a73", "content": "this is a darflen and its darfling :)", "user": "PkmnQ"}, {"id": "fce1231c7aad56a1cc2da796", "content": "Made a new community, Mythuslgy, it's like mythology, but with my special brand of silliness.", "user": "Mythus2626"}, {"id": "fedbd621660127c15fc13e33", "content": "Turns out you can make holy water on your own.
