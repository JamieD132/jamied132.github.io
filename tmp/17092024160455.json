Montgomery is holding a BOOK, ‚ÄúThe Secret Life of Bees‚Äù. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 85. MONTGOMERY (confidently whispering) Oh, don‚Äôt worry Mr. Gammil. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don‚Äôt like about bees. (to Gammil) You got the tweezers? Mr. Gammil NODS, and pats his breast pocket. MR. GAMMIL Are you allergic? MONTGOMERY Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Montgomery approaches the stand. MONTGOMERY (CONT‚ÄôD) Mr. Benson Bee. I‚Äôll ask you what I think we‚Äôd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? Montgomery points to Vanessa. BARRY We‚Äôre friends. MONTGOMERY Good friends? BARRY Yes. MONTGOMERY (softly in Barry‚Äôs face) How good? BARRY What? MONTGOMERY Do you live together? BARRY Wait a minute, this isn‚Äôt about-- "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 86. MONTGOMERY Are you her little... (clearing throat) ... bed bug? BARRY (flustered) Hey, that‚Äôs not the kind of-- MONTGOMERY I‚Äôve seen a bee documentary or two. Now, from what I understand, doesn‚Äôt your Queen give birth to all the bee children in the hive? BARRY Yeah, but-- MONTGOMERY So those aren‚Äôt even your real parents! ANGLE ON: Barry‚Äôs parents. MARTIN BENSON Oh, Barry. BARRY Yes they are! ADAM Hold me back! Vanessa holds him back with a COFFEE STIRRER. Montgomery points to Barry‚Äôs parents. MONTGOMERY You‚Äôre an illegitimate bee, aren‚Äôt you Benson? ADAM He‚Äôs denouncing bees! All the bees in the courtroom start to HUM. They‚Äôre agitated. MONTGOMERY And don‚Äôt y‚Äôall date your cousins? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 87. VANESSA (standing, letting go of Adam) Objection! Adam explodes from the table and flies towards Montgomery. ADAM I‚Äôm going to pin cushion this guy! Montgomery turns around and positions himself by the judge‚Äôs bench. He sticks his butt out. Montgomery winks at his team. BARRY Adam, don‚Äôt! It‚Äôs what he wants! Adam shoves Barry out of the way. Adam STINGS Montgomery in the butt. The jury REACTS, aghast. MONTGOMERY Ow! I‚Äôm hit! Oh, lordy, I am hit! The judge BANGS her gavel. JUDGE Order! Order! Please, Mr. Montgomery. MONTGOMERY The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a wing-ed beast of destruction. You see? You can‚Äôt treat them like equals. They‚Äôre strip-ed savages! Stinging‚Äôs the only thing they know! It‚Äôs their way! ANGLE ON: Adam, collapsed on the floor. Barry rushes to his side. BARRY Adam, stay with me. ADAM I can‚Äôt feel my legs. Montgomery falls on the Bailiff. BAILIFF Take it easy. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 88. MONTGOMERY Oh, what angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? The JURY recoils. JUDGE Please, I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! FADE TO: SEQ. 3400 - ‚ÄúADAM AT HOSPITAL‚Äù INT. HOSPITAL - STREET LEVEL ROOM - DAY PRESS PERSON #1 (V.O) The case of the honey bees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday, when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now here‚Äôs Don with the 5-day. A NURSE lets Barry into the room. Barry CARRIES a FLOWER. BARRY Thank you. Barry stands over Adam, in a bed. Barry lays the flower down next to him. The TV is on. BARRY (CONT\"D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didn‚Äôt I? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesn‚Äôt matter. The important thing is you‚Äôre alive. You could have died. ADAM I‚Äôd be better off dead. Look at me. Adam THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM (CONT‚ÄôD) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there‚Äôs a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can‚Äôt explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I‚Äôm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we‚Äôre just a couple of bugs in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY I don‚Äôt know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn‚Äôt sound so bad. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 90. BARRY Adam, they check in, but they don‚Äôt check out. Adam GULPS. ADAM Oh my. ANGLE ON: the hospital window. We see THREE PEOPLE smoking outside on the sidewalk. The smoke drifts in. Adam COUGHS. ADAM (CONT‚ÄôD) Say, could you get a nurse to close that window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees don‚Äôt smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don‚Äôt smoke. Bees don‚Äôt smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that‚Äôs it! That‚Äôs our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is? It‚Äôs not over? BARRY No. Get up. Get dressed. I‚Äôve got to go somewhere. You get back the court and stall. Stall anyway you can. CUT TO: SEQ. 3500 - ‚ÄúSMOKING GUN‚Äù INT.

ANGLE ON: The jury, all with paper boats of their own. JURORS Ooh. ANGLE ON: Montgomery frustrated with Gammil, who‚Äôs making a boat also. Monty crumples Gammil‚Äôs boat, and throws it at him. JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, it‚Äôs interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don‚Äôt make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven‚Äôt these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court‚Äôs valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. He‚Äôs suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT\"D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery‚Äôs motion. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can‚Äôt. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper\"s SMOKER onto the judge‚Äôs bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY It‚Äôs a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn‚Äôt hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or Non?" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery\"s racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He\"s playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge‚Äôs bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees! ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting "Free the bees". JUDGE The court finds in favor of the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up for a ‚Äúhigh 5‚Äù. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could do it. Highfive! She high 5‚Äôs Barry, sending him crashing to the table. He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT\"D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I‚Äôm okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we won‚Äôt have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson! You‚Äôll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry‚Äôs ‚Äòdeer in headlights‚Äô expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 94. PRESS PERSON 1 Barry, how much honey do you think is out there? BARRY Alright, alright, one at a time... SARAH Barry, who are you wearing? BARRY Uhhh, my sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. The Press follows Barry as he EXITS. ANGLE ON: Adam and Vanessa. ADAM (putting papers away) What if Montgomery‚Äôs right? VANESSA What do you mean? ADAM We‚Äôve been living the bee way a long time. 27 million years. DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 3600 - ‚ÄúHONEY ROUNDUP‚Äù EXT. HONEY FARMS APIARY - MONTAGE SARAH (V.O) Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? BARRY (V.O) (over montage) First, we‚Äôre going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then, we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed, bad breath, stink-machine. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 95. I believe we‚Äôre all aware of what they do in the woods. We will no longer tolerate derogatory beenegative nick-names, unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products, and la-dee-da tea-time human snack garnishments.

They walk through the empty factory. ADAM Yeah, but sometimes I think, so what if the humans liked our honey? Who wouldn‚Äôt? It‚Äôs the greatest thing in the world. I was excited to be a part of making it. ANGLE ON: Adam‚Äôs desk on it‚Äôs side in the hall. ADAM (CONT‚ÄôD) This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.

VANESSA Doesn‚Äôt look very good, does it? BARRY No. VANESSA And who‚Äôs fault do you think that is? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 102. BARRY Mmmm...you know, I‚Äôm going to guess, bees. VANESSA Bees? BARRY Specifically me. I guess I didn‚Äôt think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things. VANESSA And it‚Äôs not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables...they all need bees. BARRY Well, that‚Äôs our whole SAT test right there. VANESSA So, you take away the produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... BARRY The human species? VANESSA (clearing throat) Ahem! BARRY Oh. So, if there‚Äôs no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn‚Äôt it? VANESSA And I know this is also partly my fault. Barry takes a long SIGH. BARRY How about a suicide pact? VANESSA (not sure if he‚Äôs joking) How would we do it?

Montgomery is holding a BOOK, ‚ÄúThe Secret Life of Bees‚Äù. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 85. MONTGOMERY (confidently whispering) Oh, don‚Äôt worry Mr. Gammil. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don‚Äôt like about bees. (to Gammil) You got the tweezers? Mr. Gammil NODS, and pats his breast pocket. MR. GAMMIL Are you allergic? MONTGOMERY Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Montgomery approaches the stand. MONTGOMERY (CONT‚ÄôD) Mr. Benson Bee. I‚Äôll ask you what I think we‚Äôd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? Montgomery points to Vanessa. BARRY We‚Äôre friends. MONTGOMERY Good friends? BARRY Yes. MONTGOMERY (softly in Barry‚Äôs face) How good? BARRY What? MONTGOMERY Do you live together? BARRY Wait a minute, this isn‚Äôt about-- "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 86. MONTGOMERY Are you her little... (clearing throat) ... bed bug? BARRY (flustered) Hey, that‚Äôs not the kind of-- MONTGOMERY I‚Äôve seen a bee documentary or two. Now, from what I understand, doesn‚Äôt your Queen give birth to all the bee children in the hive? BARRY Yeah, but-- MONTGOMERY So those aren‚Äôt even your real parents! ANGLE ON: Barry‚Äôs parents. MARTIN BENSON Oh, Barry. BARRY Yes they are! ADAM Hold me back! Vanessa holds him back with a COFFEE STIRRER. Montgomery points to Barry‚Äôs parents. MONTGOMERY You‚Äôre an illegitimate bee, aren‚Äôt you Benson? ADAM He‚Äôs denouncing bees! All the bees in the courtroom start to HUM. They‚Äôre agitated. MONTGOMERY And don‚Äôt y‚Äôall date your cousins? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 87. VANESSA (standing, letting go of Adam) Objection! Adam explodes from the table and flies towards Montgomery. ADAM I‚Äôm going to pin cushion this guy! Montgomery turns around and positions himself by the judge‚Äôs bench. He sticks his butt out. Montgomery winks at his team. BARRY Adam, don‚Äôt! It‚Äôs what he wants! Adam shoves Barry out of the way. Adam STINGS Montgomery in the butt. The jury REACTS, aghast. MONTGOMERY Ow! I‚Äôm hit! Oh, lordy, I am hit! The judge BANGS her gavel. JUDGE Order! Order! Please, Mr. Montgomery. MONTGOMERY The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a wing-ed beast of destruction. You see? You can‚Äôt treat them like equals. They‚Äôre strip-ed savages! Stinging‚Äôs the only thing they know! It‚Äôs their way! ANGLE ON: Adam, collapsed on the floor. Barry rushes to his side. BARRY Adam, stay with me. ADAM I can‚Äôt feel my legs. Montgomery falls on the Bailiff. BAILIFF Take it easy. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 88. MONTGOMERY Oh, what angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? The JURY recoils. JUDGE Please, I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! FADE TO: SEQ. 3400 - ‚ÄúADAM AT HOSPITAL‚Äù INT. HOSPITAL - STREET LEVEL ROOM - DAY PRESS PERSON #1 (V.O) The case of the honey bees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday, when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now here‚Äôs Don with the 5-day. A NURSE lets Barry into the room. Barry CARRIES a FLOWER. BARRY Thank you. Barry stands over Adam, in a bed. Barry lays the flower down next to him. The TV is on. BARRY (CONT\"D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didn‚Äôt I? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesn‚Äôt matter. The important thing is you‚Äôre alive. You could have died. ADAM I‚Äôd be better off dead. Look at me. Adam THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM (CONT‚ÄôD) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there‚Äôs a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can‚Äôt explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I‚Äôm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we‚Äôre just a couple of bugs in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY I don‚Äôt know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn‚Äôt sound so bad. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 90. BARRY Adam, they check in, but they don‚Äôt check out. Adam GULPS. ADAM Oh my. ANGLE ON: the hospital window. We see THREE PEOPLE smoking outside on the sidewalk. The smoke drifts in. Adam COUGHS. ADAM (CONT‚ÄôD) Say, could you get a nurse to close that window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees don‚Äôt smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don‚Äôt smoke. Bees don‚Äôt smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that‚Äôs it! That‚Äôs our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is? It‚Äôs not over? BARRY No. Get up. Get dressed. I‚Äôve got to go somewhere. You get back the court and stall. Stall anyway you can. CUT TO: SEQ. 3500 - ‚ÄúSMOKING GUN‚Äù INT.

ANGLE ON: The jury, all with paper boats of their own. JURORS Ooh. ANGLE ON: Montgomery frustrated with Gammil, who‚Äôs making a boat also. Monty crumples Gammil‚Äôs boat, and throws it at him. JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, it‚Äôs interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don‚Äôt make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven‚Äôt these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court‚Äôs valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. He‚Äôs suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT\"D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery‚Äôs motion. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can‚Äôt. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper\"s SMOKER onto the judge‚Äôs bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY It‚Äôs a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn‚Äôt hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or Non?" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery\"s racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He\"s playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge‚Äôs bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees! ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting "Free the bees". JUDGE The court finds in favor of the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up for a ‚Äúhigh 5‚Äù. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could do it. Highfive! She high 5‚Äôs Barry, sending him crashing to the table. He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT\"D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I‚Äôm okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we won‚Äôt have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson! You‚Äôll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry‚Äôs ‚Äòdeer in headlights‚Äô expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 94. PRESS PERSON 1 Barry, how much honey do you think is out there? BARRY Alright, alright, one at a time... SARAH Barry, who are you wearing? BARRY Uhhh, my sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. The Press follows Barry as he EXITS. ANGLE ON: Adam and Vanessa. ADAM (putting papers away) What if Montgomery‚Äôs right? VANESSA What do you mean? ADAM We‚Äôve been living the bee way a long time. 27 million years. DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 3600 - ‚ÄúHONEY ROUNDUP‚Äù EXT. HONEY FARMS APIARY - MONTAGE SARAH (V.O) Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? BARRY (V.O) (over montage) First, we‚Äôre going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then, we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed, bad breath, stink-machine. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 95. I believe we‚Äôre all aware of what they do in the woods. We will no longer tolerate derogatory beenegative nick-names, unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products, and la-dee-da tea-time human snack garnishments.

They walk through the empty factory. ADAM Yeah, but sometimes I think, so what if the humans liked our honey? Who wouldn‚Äôt? It‚Äôs the greatest thing in the world. I was excited to be a part of making it. ANGLE ON: Adam‚Äôs desk on it‚Äôs side in the hall. ADAM (CONT‚ÄôD) This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.

VANESSA Doesn‚Äôt look very good, does it? BARRY No. VANESSA And who‚Äôs fault do you think that is? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 102. BARRY Mmmm...you know, I‚Äôm going to guess, bees. VANESSA Bees? BARRY Specifically me. I guess I didn‚Äôt think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things. VANESSA And it‚Äôs not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables...they all need bees. BARRY Well, that‚Äôs our whole SAT test right there. VANESSA So, you take away the produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... BARRY The human species? VANESSA (clearing throat) Ahem! BARRY Oh. So, if there‚Äôs no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn‚Äôt it? VANESSA And I know this is also partly my fault. Barry takes a long SIGH. BARRY How about a suicide pact? VANESSA (not sure if he‚Äôs joking) How would we do it?
